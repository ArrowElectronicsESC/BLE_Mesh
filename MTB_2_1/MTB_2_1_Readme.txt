GitHub MTB_2_1 / ModusToolbox 2.1 Tips and Tricks
2020 04 17

Cypress has released ModusToolbox 2.1
The material for the BLE_Mesh Webinar was written for ModusToolbox 2.0
As material is updated and verified for ModusToolbox 2.1, it will be posted in the GitHub MTB_2_1 directory
You can use File > Import > General > Existing projects into workspace; point to the root directory that contains the project(s) you want to import.

Please submit suggestions if any functional issues are found that prevent any demos in either MTB_2_0 or MTB_2_1 directories from working.

Thank you for your patience while we update and verify the material.
Greg and Mike
